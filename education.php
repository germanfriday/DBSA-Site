        bipolar disorder usually strikes before the age of 35. Both often go
        undiagnosed. Today an array of medications can be used alone or in combination
        to treat affective disorders. Appropriate medicine, psychotherapy, (proper diet or nutrition), exercise, appropriate rest, relaxation, de-stressing&nbsp;activities (such as meditation,&nbsp;yoga, walking, jogging, or other sports,&nbsp;etc.) and support networks appear to be the best&nbsp;ways of handling&nbsp;the approach to health.</span>

          DBSA Metro Detroit offers confidential support group meetings in Macomb, 
          Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties.
          Group leaders are unipolar and bipolar peers. There is time for people
          to talk of how they survive - and live or even laugh - with disorders.
          Similarly time is given to friends and families.</p>
