      <span class="Signoff">by Bob Dillaber</span></p>
      <p>The mystery of man’s true growth lies in an unseen foundation,
          created usually by an immense pressure.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
      filled with tears and laughter.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
      is neither upside down or downside up. It is what it is.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
      is as perfect and imperfect as nature’s law.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
        bursts forth with brilliance, then dissolves into
      blackness and back again.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
      clings to its stable foundation in spite of cracks of faith.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
        is slippery-slidey, with two steps forward and one step backward.      </p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
      can never imagine its ultimate destiny.</p>
      <p>Growth which comes in peaks and valleys,
        develops a perfection known only to its maker,
    but with fleeting glimpses by he who lives it. </p></td>
